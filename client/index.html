Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz’s has shaken up the [line to the throne](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/f941e190-ee1e-11e4-987e-00144feab7de.html?siteedition=intl), decisively shifting succession in the kingdom to a new generation of princes.

[King Salman](http://www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/973dd61e-a7a8-11e4-be63-00144feab7de.html#axzz3YeubGbtn) replaced crown prince Prince Muqrin, his half-brother, with Mohammed bin Nayef al-Saud, the king’s nephew who was previously deputy crown prince. 

The king’s son, Mohammed bin Salman, was named deputy crown prince, elevating the youthful defence minister and royal court chief to second in line to the throne.

These changes come at a [challenging time](http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/8a965110-b4c0-11e3-af92-00144feabdc0.html) for the world’s biggest oil producer, which is facing a rise in Islamist extremism in the region and low oil prices.
