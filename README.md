> Demo on how to refactor old non-responsive projects, including:

* [The Saudi royal family](https://ig.ft.com/saudi-arabia-royal-family-tree/) <small>[branch][saudibranch]</small>
* [The world's fastest elevators](https://ig.ft.com/worlds-fastest-lifts/) <small>[branch][elevatorsbranch]</small>

##Â Usage:

This branch only contains a "dist" folder, which is version controlled.

The idea is if a project doesn't require any re-writing, you can just populate dist/
and be well on your way to getting it deployed in a sustainable fashion.
